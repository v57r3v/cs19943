Please select one of the three   questions   below.
DUE: Submit to Avenue assignment drop   box on   or   before   February   24th,   11:59   p.m.   Choice #1: Gender/Sexuality and School Curriculum/Policy
Recently   politicians   in   North America   (e.g.   Florida, Alberta,   New   Brunswick, and Saskatchewan)   have   passed   bills to   limit curriculum   related to gender   identity, sexual orientation   and   sexual   health   in schools as well as   creating   policies that   curtail the   freedoms   of   2SLGBTQIA+   and   gender   nonconforming students.    Outline the   nature of this   debate   in   relation to   relevant   course   material and concepts that we   have   studied.
Do the following:
1.       Find one   (and   only   one)   popular   source,   i.e.   online   or   print   media   articles   written   by   a   journalist.   Examples   may   include   magazine articles,   newspaper articles, etc. that   deal with sex, gender   identity and changes to   school   curriculums/policies.
2.       Find one   (and only   one) journal   article,   also   known   as   a   periodical   article   (scholarly      source) on   issues   related to gender/sexuality and school   curriculum/policy   or   more   generally on children/adolescents and gender/sexuality.
3.       Then,   using the   popular source, the scholarly   source,   and   all   relevant   course   material   (lectures,   readings, and videos) answer this question:   How   are these   bans   and   restrictive   policies   related to current cultural   issues and debates   surrounding   sexuality,   gender   and   sexual   identity   in Canada and the   United States?      Please   make sure   you   properly   cite   all these sources, as   described   below.
Choice #2:   Intersex and/or Transgender Athletes in Competitive SportIn   recent years,   intersex and/or transgender athletes   (remember that transgender and   intersex   are   not the same thing so   please don’t   conflate them   in   your   paper!)   have   been   discussed   and, in some cases,   banned from   international athletics competition   in   women’s   or   men’s   divisions.
Do the following:
1.       Find one   (and   only   one)   popular   source,   i.e.   online   or   print   media   articles   written   by   a   journalist.   Examples   may   include   magazine articles,   newspaper articles, etc.) that deal   with debates surrounding   banning athletes from women’s   competitions.
2.       Find one   (and   only   one) journal   article,   also   known   as   a   periodical   article,   (scholarly   source) with debates surrounding   banning athletes from women’s   competitions   or   more   generally about trans and intersex   issues.




3.       Then,   using the   popular source, the scholarly   source,   and   all   relevant   course   material   (lectures,   readings, and videos) answer this question:   How   do   current   cultural   ideas about gender and sex   identity   influence debates about   intersex   and/or   transgender   athletes and competition?    Please   make   sure you   properly   cite   all   these   sources,   as      described   below.
Choice #3: Gender   reveal   parties
In some   North American contexts, gender   reveal   parties   have   become a   part   of   the   rite   of   passage of   pregnancy. Critics,   however, argue that they   oftentimes   reinforce gender stereotypes and gender   binaries.
Do the following:
1.       Find one   (and   only   one)   popular   source,   i.e.   online   or   print   media   articles   written   by   a   journalist.   Examples   may   include   magazine articles,   newspaper articles, etc. that   deal with gender   reveal   parties.
2.       Find one   (and   only   one) journal   article,   also   known   as   a   periodical   article,   (scholarly   source) about gender   reveal   parties or gender and child   rearing   more   generally.
3.       Then,   using the   popular source, the scholarly   source   and   citing   all   relevant   course   material   (lectures,   readings, and videos) answer this question:   How   and why   are   gender   reveal   parties controversial, and what would an   anthropologic代 写Assignment #1 – GENDER AND SEX IN THE MEDIAPython

Please   make   sure your    thesis statement answers the question asked in   the   assignment   topic   (see   questions   above).

Remember, you   must   include one   and   only   one   of   each   of   the following sources: an academic source   and   a   popular   media   source.   Marks   will   be   deducted   from your   paper   if you omit one of these sources   or   add   additional   sources   in   either   category.
No title   page: You do   not   need a title   page, and   you   do   not   need   to   put   your   name,   student   number, or   page   numbers on your   paper. We can   tell   who   you   are   on   Avenue’s   Dropbox.

Your   response will   be filtered through turnitin.com once   it   is   uploaded to Avenue.    If you   use AI, Turnitin will   identify any   articles that   include   any   or   all   plagiarism, duplication of assignments from other sources,   or the   use   of   generative   AI.      This   will   be   noted, and you will   be   reported for academic dishonesty to the   Office   of Academic   Integrity.
Citations: You are   required to cite all   course   material   as   well   as your   external   sources   using   American   Psychological Association   (APA) format   (see   below).   However, you   may   not   use any   direct quotes.   If you   use direct quotes, you will   be allocated   a   0   on   the   assignment.   Instead,      please   paraphrase and cite the source of the   information.   This   means   that   everything   must   be   put   into your own words.   For the   purposes of this   assignment,   if you take   more   than   three   words   in succession from any source, then this   is   improper   paraphrasing   (and   a   form   of   plagiarism).

In   other   words,   any   opinion that   you express should   be   backed   up   by citations/the work   of others.
Define your terms:   Please   make sure you   use correct terminology and   that   you   define   all   terms   that you   use   in your assignment, e.g. “   Intersex”   .      Please   refer to the   lecture   material to   do   this.
Please   use appropriate   language.    You are writing this as a   scholarly   assignment   not   as   an   opinion   piece or as a journalist.    Please   use formal   language that   is   not   inflammatory.
